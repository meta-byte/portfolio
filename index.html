        <p>Hi! I'm Garrett. I'm a software development student at Western Governors University and I'm studying
            full-stack web development part time at the University of Utah. I've worked in the field of IT and
            support for the past 5 years and I love figuring out how things work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include camping, hiking, hunting, building model kits, and playing video games with my
            friends. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen and I think it's really important to balance
            that with some real escapism. I was born and raised in Utah and the mountains of the Wasatch Front are in my
            opinion the best place to go for some high adventure.</p>
